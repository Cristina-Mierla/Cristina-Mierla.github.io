            Risk Prediction for Covid-19 Patients
        </h2>

                Mendix application developed using python.<br />
                Its purpose is to predict the risk of patients having Covid-19. This project serves as a tool
                 for doctors who work in the ICU, to better manage commodities for patients, such as rooms, 
                 beds and ventilators. Also, it may be very useful for family doctors to advice their patients
                 suffering from Covid-19 if they should go to the hospital or not.  <br />
                 We received a set of 1600 records from the hospital containing data about real patients. 
                 This dataset contains general information about the patients, such as age, gender, days spent in hospitalization, 
                 past illnesses and conditions and also the recovery state 
                 (cured, improved, stationary, worsened, deceased). <br />
                 One of our biggest challenge in this project was related to the data, the dataset we received was imbalanced. 
                 We tried multiple supervised machine learning models to test their accuracy, 
                 recall and precision and we decided to use a decision tree classification model.
                 We chose Decision tree because it is very fast to train, comparing to similar algorithms, it is easy to interpret, 
                 can handle outliers automatically and require less hyperparameter tuning.  <br />
                 The model not only gives a prediction, but also a confidence level for each label. This model was trained using 80% of the data and the rest was used for testing. 
                 In the end the model has a 77% accuracy, with a precision of over 68% for each output.

                My first game made with Unity. <br>
                This is a simple runner game with different levels. I am very proud of this project because
                I learned something new and I experimented with 3D objects and design. <br>
                Ypu play as a running cube that tries to avoid some obstacles. The score is counted by how
                many obstacles you passed. <br>
                The game is called "Rage Run" because it becomes very hard very fast and it gets very frustrating.
                I am still working on this project and I can one day upload it to gaming platform so that other people 
                can try it online.

                Desktop application developed in Java.<br />
                Its purpose is to manage the appointments and the patients of a dentist office.
                The doctor and the nurse can access their the database through login information: user and password. <br />
                It has a funny, intuitive and simple user interface.
                From this project I learned how to connect a database to a Java project, how to use efficiently functional
                programming and using an API. <br /><br />
                Why is this project relevant?
                Because it is shows my creativity, skills and my funny personality.
                Even though it is very simple I had so much fun writing the code for it. It only has basic
                functionalities, but they are very well written.

                This project has been completed at "Edu Hack" 2019, a 24h competition where a team of students
                needed to make a website and a business plan to solve a problem in the education system.
                Funny enough, our solution was a platform to facilitate online learning. We wanted to connect
                teachers around the world with anyone that wanted to learn. <br /> <br />
                My responsibilities for this project were writting and refining the business plan, presenting the idea and
                writing some front-end code. <br /><br />
                This competiton shows my experience and my journey with programming and putting my ideas into code.
