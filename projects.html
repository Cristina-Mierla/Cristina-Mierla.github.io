                My first game made with Unity. <br>
                This is a simple runner game with different levels. I am very proud of this project because
                I learned something new and I experimented with 3D objects and design. <br>
                Ypu play as a running cube that tries to avoid some obstacles. The score is counted by how
                many obstacles you passed. <br>
                The game is called "Rage Run" because it becomes very hard very fast and it gets very frustrating.
                I am still working on this project and I can one day upload it to gaming platform so that other people 
                can try it online.

                Desktop application developed in Java.<br />
                Its purpose is to manage the appointments and the patients of a dentist office.
                The doctor and the nurse can access their the database through login information: user and password. <br />
                It has a funny, intuitive and simple user interface.
                From this project I learned how to connect a database to a Java project, how to use efficiently functional
                programming and using an API. <br /><br />
                Why is this project relevant?
                Because it is shows my creativity, skills and my funny personality.
                Even though it is very simple I had so much fun writing the code for it. It only has basic
                functionalities, but they are very well written.

                This project has been completed at "Edu Hack" 2019, a 24h competition where a team of students
                needed to make a website and a business plan to solve a problem in the education system.
                Funny enough, our solution was a platform to facilitate online learning. We wanted to connect
                teachers around the world with anyone that wanted to learn. <br /> <br />
                My responsibilities for this project were writting and refining the business plan, presenting the idea and
                writing some front-end code. <br /><br />
                This competiton shows my experience and my journey with programming and putting my ideas into code.
