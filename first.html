                        I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Cluj-Napoca, department of Mathematics and Computer Science taught in English.
                        I describe myself as a driven, goal oriented person, always looking for new opportunities to evolve.
                        I have excellent communication skills, acquired as a result of my volunteer activities and public speaking competitions.

                        Why am I special among the many students and entry level programmers?
                        I am very aware of the fact that I am not the best programmer and I don't want lie by saying that I am even close to that.
                        I believe that I am suitable for doing this because I do it with passion and fun. For me this is
                        not only work, but a way of expressing myself.

                    My first game made with Unity. <br>
                    This is a simple runner game with different levels. I am very proud of this project because
                    I learned something new and I experimented with 3D objects and design. <br>
                    Ypu play as a running cube that tries to avoid some obstacles. The score is counted by how
                    many obstacles you passed. <br>
                    The game is called "Rage Run" because it becomes very hard very fast and it gets very frustrating.
                    I am still working on this project and I can one day upload it to gaming platform so that other people 
                    can try it online.

                    Desktop application developed in Java.<br />
                    Its purpose is to manage the appointments and the patients of a dentist office.
                    The doctor and the nurse can access their the database through login information: user and password. <br />
                    It has a funny, intuitive and simple user interface.
                    From this project I learned how to connect a database to a Java project, how to use efficiently functional
                    programming and using an API. <br /><br />
                    Why is this project relevant?
                    Because it is shows my creativity, skills and my funny personality.
                    Even though it is very simple I had so much fun writing the code for it. It only has basic
                    functionalities, but they are very well written.

                    This project has been completed at "Edu Hack" 2019, a 24h competition where a team of students
                    needed to make a website and a business plan to solve a problem in the education system.
                    Funny enough, our solution was a platform to facilitate online learning. We wanted to connect
                    teachers around the world with anyone that wanted to learn. <br /> <br />
                    My responsibilities for this project were writting and refining the business plan, presenting the idea and
                    writing some front-end code. <br /><br />
                    This competiton shows my experience and my journey with programming and putting my ideas into code.
