            I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Cluj-Napoca, department of Mathematics and Computer Science taught in English.
            I describe myself as a driven, goal oriented person, always looking for new opportunities to evolve.
            I have excellent communication skills, acquired as a result of my volunteer activities and public speaking competitions.

            Why am I special among the many students and entry level programmers?
            I am very aware of the fact that I am not the best programmer and I don't want lie by saying that I am even close to that.
            I believe that I am suitable for doing this because I do it with passion and fun. For me this is
            not only work, but a way of expressing myself.
